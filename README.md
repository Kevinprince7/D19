# D19
The Arduino is programmed in such a way that on switching ‘ON’ the Arduino, it sends a LOW to HIGH signal on the TRIG pin of all the three Ultrasonic sensors. 
These ultrasonic sensors will send an Ultrasonic wave using the ultrasonic transmitter of the sensor. 
These ultrasonic waves travel through air and on colliding with an obstacle, get reflected back. 
Programming is done in such a manner, that when this obstacle is in the range of 1.4 m of the sensor, the Arduino will play the buzzer with different delay for obstacles located on the sides, and no delay for the straight ones. 
To further enhance its performance, if the obstacle is too close (less than 0.7 m from sensor) then the vibrating motor is also activated.
When the stick is close to the fire ,it is detected by the fire sensor and inform the user that there is a flammable substance or fire nearby the user.
 The IR sensor detects the nearby pits or slopes and intimates are detected and alerts the user by giving a buzzer sound.
 The viberation sensor uses pizoelectric effect to detect changes in acceleration force and so on, when the blind person is fell down accidentially.
